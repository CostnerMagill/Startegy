# UKSC Strategizer

This repository has been succeded and progress will continue a [UKSC Strategy Simulator](https://github.com/KentuckySolarCar/strategy-sim)
[UKSC Github](https://github.com/KentuckySolarCar)

## Description

This program is what we are going to use to determine our race strategy for FSGP and ASC solar car races. Using route data and car parameters as input and using a optimizer will output a target average speed. The goal of this program is to develop a maintainable and upgradable strategy modeling program. This program will work with different cars and different routes / races as well as being able to further detail the models in the future.

## How are we doing the calculations?

Currently we are referencing equations in [The Winning Solar Car](https://www.sae.org/publications/books/content/r-343/) chapter 2.
